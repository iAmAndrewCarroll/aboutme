    <h1>About the Creative</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Andrew Thomas Carroll spent the first 35 years of his life as
        a self-hating black man. Now, after years of Psychedelic
        Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy and Shadow Hunting,
        he returns to the world with a purpose and a voice. Andrew
        was given a gift for word magic and discernment. His depth
        of vision allows him to identify the underlying incentives driving
        micro and macro decisions that impact individuals in personal
        relationship and the greater population through media programming and economic policy. 
        Additionally, Andrew strives to breathe new life into
        the Eternal Ember that is always inside of you. By sharing
        his personal journey he hopes to vulnerably demonstrate the
        poetic art of personal evolution.
        
        Andrew is a gifted speaker and loves spoken word,
        improvising vocals with a jam band, getting outside in the
        dirt, camping, hiking, water and moving his body through
        dance and weight lifting. Nutrition is a key part of mental
        health and Andrew has an intimate understanding of what it
        takes to stay lean and healthy after a lifetime of self abuse.
        Axé all day.

    <h2>Firecraft</h2>
  <p>Learning to make primitive tools and summon fire from the materials gifted us by Creator was a lifechanging moment for me.  No matter what is happening, every time I am successful in this skill I feel a massive wave of joy and assurance that I am much more than a survivor.  The deepest gratitude for <a href="https://www.davidholladay.rocks/" alt="David Halladay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Halladay</a> for taking the time to help a sneezing stranger immerse himself in nature.
